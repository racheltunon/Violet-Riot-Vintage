# Violet Riot Vintage

## Purpose
Violet Riot Vintage is an online shop based in California. It's purpose, to give the user a store where they can go back in time while also giving them a modern shopping experience. Every product is one of a kind, decisively hand chosen at local thrift shops by Christa, the owner of VRV. 
inspired by her daughter, Violet, the owner aims to inspire her customers with new ways to add a pop of vintage in their lives. She sells all kinds of vintage products varying from Home decor to accessories. The purpose of this project is to bring her vision to life, with a functional site where she can sell her products and keep track of her loving customers and followers. 
Violet Riot Vintage has a big social media presence, so making sure that she can keep track of her followers and customers is extremely important. her aesthetic instagram is what inspired the color palette of the site. 

## Technologies
This project was very much influenced by UI/UX, and to incoorperate the best user experience, I strove to make this site as easy to use as possible while making the flow of the site fluid. In order to achieve this, this site uses modern technologies like React, Firebase (to allow the user to login quick & easy), Express, NodeJS, Stripe and AnimeJS. 

## API's
Because VRV is very present on social media, this project includes the Instagram API to desplay her live feed and give new costumers who stumble on her site an opportunity to interact with her shop in different ways. 
I used Nodemailer to allow Christa to send newsletters to her customers who have registered/ordered a product from her shop. 
Stripe, is an effective way to make payments and keep track of payments. It was very important to include this API in this project since is is an Ecommerce and people will be purchasing products.
